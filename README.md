# Angular Todo App Starting Template

This repository contains the starting template files needed for the Angular Todo application.

It involves a single static HTML file, a single CSS file, and 2 images stored in the assets/images folder.

**DO NOT CHANGE** any of the structure for the assets. This is how all relevant source material will be referencing such images (_as this is usually the default location for images in your Angular applications_).
